# Analysis

## Layer 7, Head 5

This head looks at the relationship between prepositions ('under', 'on', 'in') and the nouns/noun phrases that complete their meaning. In attention maps, prepositionals give high attention to the token immediately after (usually the object). Therefore they probably represent prepositional phrases

Example Sentences:
- The cat sat on the [MASK].
- She placed the book on the [MASK].

## Layer 8, Head 2

The head looks at the link between verbs and their direct objects. In the attention maps, the verb token typically sends the highest attention to the object noun that completes its meaning. Therefore it captures the relationship between an action and the thing it is acting upon.

Example Sentences:
- The chef cooked the [MASK].
- They built a [MASK] by the river.
